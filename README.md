How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  When implementing user needs into a program, "user stories" works best. This type of information is created through clear and consice communication between the Stakeholder/Client/Customer and the Product Owner and Scrum Master. The "user story" helps by compartmentalizing that data being discussed into clear objectives that are more easily understood and created.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  For developing programs, I feel that it is most important to have your work space organized, and Agile provides the tools to keep yourslef organized along with being adaptable and flexible. Agile creates this sense that major projects are smaller than what they appear to be, by breaking the complete project down into multiple sections "sprints." Daily Scrum Meetings are a plus to, in that they allow for the whole team to address any issues and see where everything is at with the state of the project. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  To be a good team member in software development, is to be someone that is very open and easy to comunicate with. They are not afraid to admit when certain issues are out of their scope of understanding, but at the same time are able to give assistance to others on the team when it is needed. They demonstrate confidence while in the workspace and make sure that their tasks are completed in a timely manner as to not slow down the project's projected completion date. A good team member also knows when to say "NO." This is for the case of taking on someone else work fully while they slack off or when an idea comes up that is being decided on without the approval of higher ups.
